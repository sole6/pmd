/**
 * Base class for controllers of the app. The main window of the app is split
 * into regions corresponding to some area of functionality. Each has its own
 * FXML file that can be found in the fxml resource directory. Each also has
 * its own independent controller. Since the FXML regions are nested like a
 * tree (the JavaFX scene graph), it's natural to link the controllers in a
 * tree too.
 *
 * <p>For now controllers mostly communicate by sending messages to their parent
 * and letting it forward the message to the rest of the app.
 * TODO I'm more and more convinced we should avoid that and stop having the controllers
 *  hold a reference to their parent. They should only communicate by exposing properties
 *  their parent binds to, but they shouldn't know about their parent.
 *  {@link MessageChannel}s can allow us to decouple them even more.
 *
 * <p>This class mainly exists to make the initialization cycle of JavaFX clearer. Children controllers
 * are initialized before their parent, but sometimes they should only
 * perform some actions after its parent has been initialized, e.g. binding
 * properties that depend on a restored setting or stuff. This is part
 * of the reason why {@link Platform#runLater(Runnable)} can sometimes
 * be enough to solve initialization problems.
 *
 * <p>This only works if all controllers in the initialization sequence of an
 * FXML file extend this class.
 *
