### New and noteworthy

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.16.0).

#### PLSQL Grammar Updates

The grammar has been updated to support inline constraints in CREATE TABLE statements. Additionally, the
CREATE TABLE statement may now be followed by physical properties and table properties. However, these
properties are skipped over during parsing.

The CREATE VIEW statement now supports subquery views.

The EXTRACT function can now be parsed correctly. It is used to extract values from a specified
datetime field. Also date time literals are parsed now correctly.

The CASE expression can now be properly used within SELECT statements.

Table aliases are now supported when specifying columns in INSERT INTO clauses.

#### New Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/bestpractices/DoubleBraceInitialization" %} (`java-bestpractices`)
    detects non static initializers in anonymous classes also known as "double brace initialization".
    This can be problematic, since a new class file is generated and object holds a strong reference
    to the surrounding class.
    
    Note: This rule is also part of the Java quickstart ruleset (`rulesets/java/quickstart.xml`).

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/bestpractices/UnusedPrivateField" %} (`java-bestpractices`) now ignores by
    default fields, that are annotated with the Lombok experimental annotation `@Delegate`. This can be
    customized with the property `ignoredAnnotations`.

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/design/SingularField" %} (`java-design`) now ignores by
    default fields, that are annotated with the Lombok experimental annotation `@Delegate`. This can be
    customized with the property `ignoredAnnotations`.

*   The Java rules {% rule "java/multithreading/UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter" %} and
    {% rule "java/multithreading/UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter" %} (`java-multithreading`)
    now prefer synchronized blocks by default. They will raise a violation, if the synchronization is implemented
    on the method level. To allow the old behavior, the new property `allowMethodLevelSynchronization` can
    be enabled.

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/design/UseUtilityClass" %} (`java-design`) has a new property `ignoredAnnotations`.
    By default, classes that are annotated with Lombok's `@UtilityClass` are ignored now.

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/NonStaticInitializer" %} (`java-errorprone`) does not report
    non static initializers in anonymous classes anymore. For this use case, there is a new rule now:
    {% rule "java/bestpractices/DoubleBraceInitialization" %} (`java-bestpractices`).

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/CommentDefaultAccessModifier" %) (`java-codestyle`) was enhanced
    in the last version 6.15.0 to check also top-level types by default. This created many new violations.
    Missing the access modifier for top-level types is not so critical, since it only decreases the visibility
    of the type.
    
    The default behaviour has been restored. If you want to enable the check for top-level types, you can
    use the new property `checkTopLevelTypes`.

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/CloseResource" %} (`java-errorprone`) now by default searches
    for any unclosed `java.lang.AutoCloseable` resource. This includes now the standard `java.io.*Stream` classes.
    Previously only SQL-related resources were considered by this rule. The types can still be configured
    via the `types` property. Some resources do not need to be closed (e.g. `ByteArrayOutputStream`). These
    exceptions can be configured via the new property `allowedResourceTypes`.
    In order to restore the old behaviour, just remove the type `java.lang.AutoCloseable` from the `types`
    property and keep the remaining SQL-related classes.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/AvoidFinalLocalVariable" %} (`java-codestyle`) has been deprecated
    and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. The rule is controversial and also contradicts other existing
    rules such as {% rule "java/codestyle/LocalVariableCouldBeFinal" %}. If the goal is to avoid defining
    constants in a scope smaller than the class, then the rule {% rule "java/errorprone/AvoidDuplicateLiterals" %}
    should be used instead.

### API Changes

#### Deprecated APIs

> Reminder: Please don't use members marked with the annotation {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}, as they will likely be removed, hidden, or otherwise intentionally broken with 7.0.0.


##### In ASTs

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated **in the Java AST** (with other languages to come):

* Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and marked {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser, which for rules, means that never need to instantiate node themselves. Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
* **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. Version 7.0.0 will bring a new set of abstractions that will be public API, but the base classes are and will stay internal. You should not couple your code to them.
  * In the meantime you should use interfaces like {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.JavaNode %} or  {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %}, or the other published interfaces in this package, to refer to nodes generically.
  * Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
* Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**. We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.

Please look at {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.ast %} to find out the full list
of deprecations.
