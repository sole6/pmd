### New and noteworthy

#### Call For Logo

We are still searching for a new logo for PMD for the next major release.

Learn more about how to participate on [github issue 1663](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1663).

#### Java 12 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 12. PMD can parse the new [Switch Expressions](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325)
and resolve the type of such an expression.

Note: The Switch Expressions are a preview language feature of OpenJDK 12 and are not enabled by default. In order to
analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable it via the new environment
variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd ...

#### Quickstart Ruleset for Apex

PMD provides now a quickstart ruleset for Salesforce.com Apex, which you can use as a base ruleset to
get your custom ruleset started. You can reference it with `rulesets/apex/quickstart.xml`.
You are strongly encouraged to [create your own ruleset](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.12.0/pmd_userdocs_making_rulesets.html)
though.

The quickstart ruleset has the intention, to be useful out-of-the-box for many projects. Therefore it
references only rules, that are most likely to apply everywhere.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

#### PMD Designer

The rule designer's codebase has been moved out of the main repository and
will be developed at [pmd/pmd-designer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer)
from now on. The maven coordinates will stay the same for the time being.
The designer will still be shipped with PMD's binaries.

#### Improved Apex Support

*   Many AST nodes now expose more information which makes it easier to write XPath-based rules for Apex. Here are
    some examples:
    *   `Annotation[@Resolved = false()]` finds unsupported annotations.
    *   `AnnotationParameter[@Name='RestResource'][@Value='/myurl']` gives access to
        annotation parameters.
    *   `CatchBlockStatement[@ExceptionType='Exception'][@VariableName='e']` finds catch
        block for specific exception types.
    *   `Field[@Type='String']` find all String fields, `Field[string-length(@Name) < 5]`
        finds all fields with short names and `Field[@Value='a']` find alls fields, that are
        initialized with a specific value.
    *   `LiteralExpression[@String = true()]` finds all String literals. There are attributes
        for each type: `@Boolean`, `@Integer`, `@Double`, `@Long`, `@Decimal`, `@Null`.
    *   `Method[@Constructor = true()]` selects all constructors. `Method[@ReturnType = 'String']`
        selects all methods that return a String.
    *   The `ModifierNode` node has a couple of attributes to check for the existence of specific
        modifiers: `@Test`, `@TestOrTestSetup`, `@WithSharing`, `@WithoutSharing`, `@InheritedSharing`,
        `@WebService`, `@Global`, `@Override`.
    *   Many nodes now expose their type. E.g. with `Parameter[@Type='Integer']` you can find all
        method parameters of type Integer. The same attribute `Type` exists as well for:
        `NewObjectExpression`, `Property`, `VariableDeclaration`.
    *   `VariableExpression[@Image='i']` finds all variable usages of the variable "i".

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/design/AvoidUncheckedExceptionsInSignatures" %} (`java-design`) finds methods or constructors
    that declare unchecked exceptions in their `throws` clause. This forces the caller to handle the exception,
    even though it is a runtime exception.

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/DetachedTestCase" %} (`java-errorprone`) searches for public
    methods in test classes, which are not annotated with `@Test`. These methods might be test cases where
    the annotation has been forgotten. Because of that those test cases are never executed.

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/bestpractices/WhileLoopWithLiteralBoolean" %} (`java-bestpractices`) finds
    Do-While-Loops and While-Loops that can be simplified since they use simply `true` or `false` as their
    loop condition.

*   The new Apex rule {% rule "apex/bestpractices/ApexAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage" %} (`apex-bestpractices`)
    searches for assertions in unit tests and checks, whether they use a message argument.

*   The new Apex rule {% rule "apex/bestpractices/ApexUnitTestMethodShouldHaveIsTestAnnotation" %} (`apex-bestpractices`)
    searches for methods in test classes, which are missing the `@IsTest` annotation.

*   The new PLSQL rule {% rule "plsql/codestyle/AvoidTabCharacter" %} (`plsql-codestyle`) checks, that there are
    no tab characters ("\t") in the source file.

*   The new PLSQL rule {% rule "plsql/codestyle/LineLength" %} (`plsql-codestyle`) helps to enforce a maximum
    line length.

### API Changes

#### Command Line Interface

The start scripts `run.sh`, `pmd.bat` and `cpd.bat` support the new environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS`.
This can be used to set arbitrary JVM options for running PMD, such as memory settings (e.g. `PMD_JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m`)
or enable preview language features (e.g. `PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview`).

The previously available variables such as `OPTS` or `HEAPSIZE` are deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.

#### Deprecated API

*   {% jdoc core::renderers.CodeClimateRule %} is deprecated in 7.0.0 because it was unused for 2 years and
    created an unwanted dependency.
    Properties "cc_categories", "cc_remediation_points_multiplier", "cc_block_highlighting" will also be removed.
    See [#1702](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/1702) for more.

*   The Apex ruleset `rulesets/apex/ruleset.xml` has been deprecated and will be removed in 7.0.0. Please use the new
    quickstart ruleset `rulesets/apex/quickstart.xml` instead.
